✔ recursion
	- still failing for doctor.js/test166.js
	- 'object's never .equals()
✔ proper Array with numProps
✔ difference between setProp and getProp
✔ better implicit .prototype creation

- exact ForInStatement
	- needs non-enumerable properties
✔ isTruthy/Falsy for ConditionalExpression, || and &&, !, `in`
	- testing truthfullness for 0 numbers would break doctor.js tests
✔ record values in each Expression node for autocompletion
	✔ getPropNames for Value/Reference
	- this is done for objects of MemberExpressions only for now
- difference between `undefined` and `any`
✔ Exceptions
	✔ return a tuple of retVal, throwVal

✔ Global object for `this`
- new with return
- Other stdlib improvements
	- JSON
